    This letter can be considered as an evidence for the confirmation of the Officer like qualities present in an individual . A candidate is interviewed for 5 days and different officials from the defence forces examines his personality by putting him under different situations. There is a lot of competition in this process , as a high number of candidates appears for this process, but only a few of them makes it to the merit list . I am happy to say that , I am one of those recommended candidates. This confirmation letter reveals that I am capable of leading a team efficiently, capable of mixing up with new people and can handle the situation tactfully. </p>
